// let is to create a variable
let message = "Hello";

//alert(message);

let hello = "Hello world!";

let world;

//copies "Hello world!" from hello into world
world = hello;

//now both variables hold the same data.
//alert(hello);
//alert(world);

//variable can only be declared once with let,
//after should just be referred to by variable name 

//to declare a constant us const instead of let

//numbers in arithmetic are called operands (including variables)
//operation to be performed are operators (like +, -)
//javascript numbers are always 64-bit floating point
//accurate up to 15 digits

//const twoDecimalPlaces = lotsOfDecimal.toFixed(2); will return a number to 2 decimal places
